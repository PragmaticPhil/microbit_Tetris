Each node has a variety of 9 preset frames.
This is because node code for this is very light, and by storing these values in the node we take some load of the server
and limit the amount of information we need to transfer over radio:

... GENERIC HIGH FREQUENCY ONES:
A couple of familiar ones that are used throughout:
image_SpecialPreset_Full = "99999:99999:99999:99999:99999"
image_SpecialPreset_Null = "00000:00000:00000:00000:00000"


... ANIMATION FRAMES:
Sideways movement is in block of 1 micro:bit wide, which removes any need for sideways scrolling
However, the movement DOWN the matrix needs to be smooth.

So, we need a representation of each block for each of 5 locations running 'down' the micro:bit:

image_AnimationPresets =    [   image_SpecialPreset_Full,
                                "09999:09999:09999:09999:09999",
                                "00999:00999:00999:00999:00999",
                                "00099:00099:00099:00099:00099",
                                "00009:00009:00009:00009:00009",
                                image_SpecialPreset_Null
                            ]
Note - the index of the array above corresponds to the frame of animation, which is controlled by the server.
So - server will tell a node to display a block, and will send a frame val.  Node will pick the image from the above that corresponds


... BLOCKS WITH BORDERS
When blocks come to rest at the bottom of the screen we draw a boarder around them.  
This will ensure that the separate shapes are still discrenable when they come to rest:

image_BorderPresets =       [   image_SpecialPreset_Null, 
                                image_SpecialPreset_Full, 
                                "55555:99999:99999:99999:99999", 
                                "59999:59999:59999:59999:59999",
                                "99995:99995:99995:99995:99995",
                                "59995:59995:59995:59995:59995",
                                "55555:59999:59999:59999:59999",
                                "55555:99995:99995:99995:99995",
                                "55555:59995:59995:59995:59995"
                            ]
                
imagePresets[0] = blank screen
imagePresets[1] = All pixels on ('block')
imagePresets[2] = block with top border
imagePresets[3] = block with border on left side
imagePresets[4] = block with border on right side
imagePresets[5] = block with border on right and left side
imagePresets[6] = block with border on top and left
imagePresets[7] = block with border on top and right
imagePresets[8] = block with border on top, left and left

As blocks collect at the bottom and stack they are 'separated' by a border of lighter pixels.
Borders are above, left and right - we don't bother with below (no need - if they stack the one below will have a border on its top)
