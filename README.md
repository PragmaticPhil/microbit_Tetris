# microbit_Tetris
Uses the micro:bit image matrix code as a basis to run tetris on a matrix of micro:bits

No Matrix?  No worries...

If you DON'T have lots of micro:bits lying around and time to set up a huge matrix then use reptris.py for a standalone version that prints frames to REPL; you only need 1 micro:bit for this:

... use the MU editor

... open the REPL - make it quite large

... flash and run it (of course keep USB plugged in).

... the game will run in the REPL

There is no scoring (memory is scarce!) but actually getting a tetris is quite an achievement (roatate is sticky and its really hard to see properly!).  There's also 1 tiny bit of functionality missing - I'll leave that to you to spot though!
