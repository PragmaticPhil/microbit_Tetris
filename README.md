# microbit_Tetris
Uses the micro:bit image matrix code as a basis to run tetris on a matrix of micro:bits

No Matrix?  No worries...
If you DON'T have lots of micro:bits lying around and time to set up a huge matrix then use reptris.py for a standalone version that prints frames to REPL... you only need 1 micro:bit for this:

... use the MU editor

... open the REPL - make it quite large

... flash and run it (of course keep USB plugged in).

... the game will run in the REPL
