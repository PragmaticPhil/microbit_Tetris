The server will send 2 types of data:

  

Type0: Server Instructions:


  Examples:
  
  1 - Setting matrix size (which tells hardcoded nodes where they sit on the matrix)
  tX0620305 = tX  0   62  03  05


Type1: Screen Update Instructions:

    For usual game play each node has 2 states:
    ... OFF (no pixels burning)
    ... ON  (all pixel burning)
    
    So, each frame update the server just needs to tell nodes whether to show a block or nothing
    Given that all that happens on screen is a piece moves, this means each frame update will include
    not more than 5 rows of data.
    
    As the block moves down the screen it scrolls smoothly, so with each new animation frame 1 row of pixels is switched off
    We have to pass in frame number (0 -4) so node knows which block to show:
    
    This type of instruction looks like this:
    
      tX12005100101
      tX  -  1  -  20  -  3  -  05  -  100101
      ServerID - message type - server instruction - animation frame - target row - row mask

    Now, to smoothly scroll downwards we need to advance the block down the matrix 1 line at a time
    to do this the Server Instruction field above encoded FRAME.
    Each node has a buffer of images - each one a block that has shifted down by 1 row relative to the previous one:
    
    F0 =  *****
          *****
          *****
          *****
          *****
          
    F1 =  -----
          *****
          *****
          *****
          *****

    F2 =  -----
          -----
          *****
          *****
          *****

etc
