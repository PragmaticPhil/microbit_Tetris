The server will send 2 types of data:

  

Type0: Server Instructions:


  Examples:
  
  1 - Setting matrix size (which tells hardcoded nodes where they sit on the matrix)
  tX0620305 = tX  0   62  03  05


Type1: Screen Update Instructions:

    For usual game play each node has 2 states:
    ... OFF (no pixels burning)
    ... ON  (all pixel burning)
    
    So, each frame update the server just needs to tell nodes whether to CHANGE!
    Given that all that happens on screen is a piece moves, this means each frame update will include
    not more than 5 rows of data.
    
    This type of instruction looks like this:
    
      tX12005100101
      tX  -  1  -  20  -  05  -  100101
      ServerID - message type - server instruction - target row - row mask
